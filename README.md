This is basic configuration for React (created at 25.03.2018)

## I used latest version of

- Babel 7.0.0
- Webpack 4.2.0
- Typescript 2.7.2
- React 16.2.0


## Start

- install YARN https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/
- in root directory type command `yarn` which installs all dependencies

## Run development

- `yarn start` - start development env
- `yarn build` - start production env and create public directory with source code.

## Conclusions

I remembered how it was working before updates. After run `webpack` command this creates always additional directory with source code and I was so confused it does not work now.
It just works! Seems like Webpack server does all job for us and creates source code on itself.

## Notice!

I didn't test it test with more advance code yet - I ma still learning and any suggestions are very welcome.
